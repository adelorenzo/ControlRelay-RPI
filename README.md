# ControlRelay-RPI

This is a very simple script that detects a paired bluetooth device/phone with your Raspberry Pi3 and controls a relay module connected via GPIO. Other Raspberry Pi versions will not work unless you attache a bluetooth dongle via USB.

Please refer to my other project https://github.com/adelorenzo/Simple-PHP-GPIO for the connection settings and hardware I use for this project.
